                <h1>Immersive Car Simulation in Unreal Engine</h1>
                <p>Driving through a detailed map of Corvallis using high-fidelity hardware in Unreal Engine.</p>

      <div class="feature-item">
          <h3>Map Creation & Integration</h3>
          <p>The map of Corvallis is sourced from OpenStreetMap and then imported into CityEngine for rule-based modeling. This process involves designing the street network, buildings, and other urban structures. Afterward, the map is imported into Unreal Engine for final integration, where itâ€™s enhanced with additional environmental details and physics for the driving experience.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="feature-item">
          <h3>Realistic Car Physics</h3>
          <p>The car simulation is powered by realistic car physics in Unreal Engine, enabling dynamic interactions with the environment. Using input from hardware like manual transmission, steering wheels, and pedals, the car mimics real-world driving behavior, enhancing the immersion of the simulation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
          <h3>Immersive VR Experience</h3>
          <p>The simulator integrates with VR headsets like Oculus Quest Pro and Varjo XR-4 to provide a fully immersive experience. Combined with haptic feedback devices like TactSuit X40, users can feel the simulation in a more tangible way, enhancing the realism of the driving experience.</p>

        <!-- Future Enhancements -->
        <section class="future-plans">
            <h2 class="header-body">Future Enhancements</h2>
            <p>We plan to further enhance the simulator with **AI-driven traffic systems**, **vehicle customization options**, and **multi-user experiences**. These features will allow users to interact with each other in real-time, further enhancing the simulationâ€™s realism and interactivity.</p>
