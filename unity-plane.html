      <div class="feature-item">
          <h3>Choose your experience</h3>
          <p>As with the rest of the XR seating buck, the jet simulation is meant to be interactive. Use VR or a normal screen, fully adjust your physical environment, play with keyboard or mockups of real A-10C warthog hardware</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="feature-item">
          <h3>Realistic Plane Physics</h3>
          <p>The car simulation is powered by realistic car physics in Unreal Engine, enabling dynamic interactions with the environment. Using input from hardware like manual transmission, steering wheels, and pedals, the car mimics real-world driving behavior, enhancing the immersion of the simulation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
          <h3>Interactive interior</h3>
          <p>The interior of the jet plane features several elements taken from real airplanes to help you more easily learn to fly. A working GPS; a HUD telling you your speed, pitch, and yaw with a horizon marker; and cameras to help you see the outside of your plane from different angles</p>

  <!-- Problem Statement Section -->
<section class="features-workflow">
    <h2 class="header-body">Problem Statement</h2>
  
    <div class="feature-item">
      <h3>Teaching Flight Basics</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this program is to teach the user the basics of how they could fly an airplane. This needs to be accomplished in two parts:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Realistic Physics Simulation</li>
            <p>- The airplane must be made to feel as similar to a real plane as possible by gathering as much reference material as possible. This was done through a combination of studying airplane cockpit tour videos, airplane flight videos, jet plane discussion forums, and a few pages describing airplane physics</p>
        <li>A detailed tutorial</li>
            <p>- While having all of the features is nice, most users wonâ€™t be able to intuit how to fly an airplane. When testing with my teammates, everyone knew how to operate the throttle but the pedals frequently proved to be an issue and no one knew fully the correct procedure for takeoff or landing. This showed the need for a structured tutorial</p>
            <p>- The tutorial covers takeoff, flight, and landing. Each section describes what you should be doing in text with animated gifs showing the relevant locations on the screen and animations of what you should be doing</p>
            <p>- Each tutorial can use proximity to points to decide when theyâ€™re done. When youâ€™re high enough in the air youâ€™ve taken off, when youâ€™re at cruising altitude youâ€™re flying, and when youâ€™re close to the final airport itâ€™ll tell you how to land</p>
            <p>- Unfortunately, a lot of learning a plane can be boiled down to intuition so users may not get this correct on their first try but thatâ€™s the point of a simulation</p>
        </ol>

  <!-- Input Section -->
  <section class="features-workflow">
    <h2 class="header-body">Input</h2>
  
    <div class="feature-item">
      <img src="Images/InputDiagram.png" style="max-width: 50%;" />
      <p>Input in Unity is abstracted into generic actions that are read out as a data type (bool for button, float for slider, etc). This way, the code doesn't have to worry about specific devices or combinations of devices. Mapping controllers to actions is as simple as pressing a button on the controller and listening for said button.</p>

  <!-- Environment Section -->

    <div class="feature-item">
      <h3>GIS map data</h3>
      <p>We use Cesium's Bing terrain and Google 3d tiles to render the world that the user flies over.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-item">
      <h3>Forest data</h3>
      <p>Cesium for Unity does not support vector or point data, so for the forest where the fire is, we used an OSM extract of the area (via https://www.openstreetmap.org/export).</p>
    </div>

  <!-- Logic Section -->
  <section class="features-workflow">
    <h2 class="header-body">Logic</h2>
  
    <div class="feature-item">
      <h3>Visual Navigation</h3>
      <p>The GPS is integrated into the cockpit screen, showing a dot for the playerâ€™s position and another for the destination. A connecting line guides flight. Once close enough, both disappear and the player is notified of arrival.</p>
