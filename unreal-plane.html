      <div class="feature-item">
          <h3>Choose your experience</h3>
          <p>As with the rest of the XR seating buck, the jet simulation is meant to be interactive. Use an XR headset to experience the plane in virtual reality or a normal computer screen.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="feature-item">
          <h3>Realistic Plane Physics</h3>
          <p>The plane's movements are powered by a combination of Unreal Engine's built-in physics and hours of research on realistic jet plane handling. Experience lift, drag, and all other forces that would be experienced when flying a real plane while you learn controls and handling.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
          <h3>Interactive interior</h3>
          <p>The interior of the jet plane features several elements taken from real airplanes to help you more easily learn to fly. A working GPS; a HUD telling you your speed, pitch, and yaw with a horizon marker; and cameras to help you see the outside of your plane from different angles</p>

    <h2 class="header-body">Purpose</h2>
  
    <div class="feature-item">
      <h3>Teaching Flight Basics</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this program is to teach the user the basics of how they could fly an airplane. This needs to be accomplished in two parts:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Realistic Physics Simulation</li>
            <p>- The airplane must be made to feel as similar to a real plane as possible by gathering as much reference material as possible. This was done through a combination of studying airplane cockpit tour videos, airplane flight videos, jet plane discussion forums, and a few pages describing airplane physics</p>
        <li>A detailed tutorial</li>
            <p>- While having all of the features is nice, most users wonâ€™t be able to intuit how to fly an airplane. When testing with my teammates, everyone knew how to operate the throttle but the pedals frequently proved to be an issue and no one knew fully the correct procedure for takeoff or landing. This showed the need for a structured tutorial</p>
            <p>- The tutorial covers takeoff, flight, and landing. Each section describes what you should be doing in text with animated gifs showing the relevant locations on the screen and animations of what you should be doing</p>
            <p>- Each tutorial can use proximity to points to decide when theyâ€™re done. When youâ€™re high enough in the air youâ€™ve taken off, when youâ€™re at cruising altitude youâ€™re flying, and when youâ€™re close to the final airport itâ€™ll tell you how to land</p>
            <p>- Unfortunately, a lot of learning a plane can be boiled down to intuition so users may not get this correct on their first try but thatâ€™s the point of a simulation</p>
        </ol>

  <!-- Mechanics Section -->
  <section class="features-workflow">
    <h2 class="header-body">Mechanics Used to Drive the Airplane</h2>
  
    <div class="feature-item">
      <h3>Physics Forces</h3>
      <img src = "Images/PlaneDiagram.png" alt = "diagram of an airplane with arrows displaying different physics forces such as wind resistance, gravity, lift, and the movement of the plane itself.">
    </div>
  
    <div class="feature-item">
      <h3>Basic Input</h3>
      <p>
        Input was mapped internally using the Raw Input plugin for Windows which converts inputs from any controller detected by the operating system into raw data that can then be mapped to actions as generic buttons and axes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The system works very well for steering wheels but unfortunately 
        itâ€™s not made to use multiple controllers for a single actor such as with the HOTAS used for 
        our airplane simulation which was split between a Yoke, Throttle, and Pedal controller that each ran separately. 
        In order to get input to work, I wrote down all of the button and 
        axis maps for each controller and then chose an order for those controllers 
        that I liked. Afterwards, I shifted each controller so the buttons did not 
        overlap with previous controllers to get all buttons to function as inputs.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="feature-item">
      <h3>Wind Resistance & Gravity</h3>
      <p>When applying basic forces with input, these forces can compound on 
        themselves infinitely and cause erratic behavior while driving 
        (mainly a very rapidly spinning aircraft). How this is kept in check 
        in real life is through wind resistance and gravity.</p>
      <p>
        Gravity counteracts lift (lift being the force that pushes the plane 
        upwards when itâ€™s moving sufficiently fast).
      </p>
      <p>
        Wind resistance counteracts turning and acceleration. 
        Small factors such as tilting the plane in a direction itâ€™s not 
        currently moving, keeping your landing gear out, and being at 
        the wrong altitude all affect the planeâ€™s ability to move as 
        efficiently through the wind. This requires the user to engage 
        more while theyâ€™re flying and make sure that theyâ€™re sitting at 
        cruising altitude to keep their plane running at peak efficiency.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>
  
  <!-- GPS System Section -->
  <section class="features-workflow">
    <h2 class="header-body">GPS System</h2>
    <div class="feature-item">
      <p>In order to make it easier for the user to navigate from one airport to 
        another, it seemed necessary to integrate a gps system into the jet plane. 
        The Goal of the GPS was to display on one of the two integrated monitors in 
        the cockpit. Once dot would represent the userâ€™s aircraft and a second dot 
        would represent the location theyâ€™re meant to fly to. Between these points 
        is a straight line the player can follow (since theyâ€™re to fly to their 
        destination). The GPS will then terminate both points and notify the user 
        when theyâ€™ve arrived at their destination.</p>
        <p>
          This system is ideal both because itâ€™s a real feature used by airplane 
          pilots including on jet planes, and because most people already have 
          prior experience with a GPS which helps make more parts of our system 
          intuitive for the user to work with.

    <h2 class="header-body">Map Streaming and Using Multiple Maps at Once</h2>
    <div class="feature-item">
      <p>
        Realistic maps are large and expensive to create both in terms of money and 
        resources. To create a simulator that works in virtual reality, we needed a 
        system to overcome these obstacles and we found that system with Cesium.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cesium is a tool that streams data from both Bing Maps and Google Maps. 
        Itâ€™s possible to obtain a GPS map, flat aerial photos of the ground, and low 
        fidelity 3d models. The Unreal Jet project ended up using the 3d models to 
        represent the ground since they give depth and from far away they still have 
        enough detail to appear realistic to the user

    <h2 class="header-body">Tutorial System</h2>
    <div class="feature-item">
      <p>
        The goal of the tutorial system is to provide a lightweight but still comprehensive set of instructions to teach the user how to fly the plane during different points in their trip from Albany to Corvallis. 
        They'll be taught how to drive on the tarmac, fly, and land their airplane.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tutorial will be a widget displayed in 3d space. It's attached to the interior of the plane with buttons that are interactable with the buttons on the jet-plane's yoke. Each tutorial activates just before the user needs to learn the relevant information:
        Driving on startup, flying just as the user begins to take off (roughly 200 meters in the air), and landing right as the user arrives at their destination (the Corvallis Airport). Like this web page, the tutorials all have a cheat sheet in the form of a button that opens a new window with definitions built onto it.
