          <h3>Choose your experience</h3>
          <p>As with the rest of the XR seating buck, the jet simulation is meant to be interactive. Use VR or a normal screen, fully adjust your physical environment, play with keyboard or mockups of real A-10C warthog hardware</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="feature-item">
          <h3>Realistic Plane Physics</h3>
          <p>The car simulation is powered by realistic car physics in Unreal Engine, enabling dynamic interactions with the environment. Using input from hardware like manual transmission, steering wheels, and pedals, the car mimics real-world driving behavior, enhancing the immersion of the simulation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
          <h3>Interactive interior</h3>
          <p>The interior of the jet plane features several elements taken from real airplanes to help you more easily learn to fly. A working GPS; a HUD telling you your speed, pitch, and yaw with a horizon marker; and cameras to help you see the outside of your plane from different angles</p>
