        <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
                In order to study and develop simulation technology with new hardware, we need to assemble and develop software for an extended reality seating buck. 
                The buck itself must be modular to allow the components to easily be adjusted and swapped out. The software created for it must be developed to be easily workable with a variety of hardware. 
                How each project attempts to accomplish this task may be found in the "Projects" tab.
