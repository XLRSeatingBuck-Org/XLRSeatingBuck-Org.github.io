        <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
        <p>We're a cross-functional team of students specializing in software development, hardware design, XR
            integration, and system testing.</p>

                <p>Project partner and group coordinator. In charge of ordering components and advising the rest of the

                <p> I developed a realistic fire suppression simulation in Unity that replicates real-world firefighting
                    techniques. The simulation includes a firetruck that extends and directs water streams to extinguish
                    fires on the ground, as well as an aircraft that releases water or fire retardant from above to
                    control wildfires. This project showcases my ability to model complex emergency response scenarios
                    using interactive and physics-based systems within a dynamic virtual environment.</p>

                <p>Implemented all features in the Unreal Jet simulator and worked jointly on the website. He was in
                    charge of managing physics, making an airplane class from scratch, and the main researched on how
                    airplanes move for the rest of the team</p>

                <p>
                    My focus is on making the virtual environments more natural and flexible replicating our local town of Corvallis. I used City Engine to place houses, streets and assets (powerlines, solar panels) all imported from Open Street Map. I also integrated this model into Unreal Engine and fill the environment with procedural content.

                <p>I developed the vehicle physics simulations for the Unity firetruck and jet, as well as the input logic for both vehicles. I also made most of the top-level logic for directing the entire experience, including win/lose scenarios.</p>
