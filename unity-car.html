      <h2 class="header-body">Key Features and Workflow</h2>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Choose your experience</h3>
        <p>As with the rest of the XR seating buck, the jet simulation is meant to be interactive. Use VR or a normal
          screen, fully adjust your physical environment, play with keyboard or mockups of real A-10C warthog hardware
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Realistic Plane Physics</h3>
        <p>The car simulation is powered by realistic car physics in Unreal Engine, enabling dynamic interactions with
          the environment. Using input from hardware like manual transmission, steering wheels, and pedals, the car
          mimics real-world driving behavior, enhancing the immersion of the simulation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Interactive interior</h3>
        <p>The interior of the jet plane features several elements taken from real airplanes to help you more easily
          learn to fly. A working GPS; a HUD telling you your speed, pitch, and yaw with a horizon marker; and cameras
          to help you see the outside of your plane from different angles</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Problem Statement Section -->
    <section class="features-workflow">
      <h2 class="header-body">Problem Statement</h2>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Teaching Flight Basics</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this program is to teach the user the basics of how they could fly an airplane. This needs to
          be accomplished in two parts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Realistic Physics Simulation</li>
          <p>- The airplane must be made to feel as similar to a real plane as possible by gathering as much reference
            material as possible. This was done through a combination of studying airplane cockpit tour videos, airplane
            flight videos, jet plane discussion forums, and a few pages describing airplane physics</p>
          <li>A detailed tutorial</li>
          <p>- While having all of the features is nice, most users won’t be able to intuit how to fly an airplane. When
            testing with my teammates, everyone knew how to operate the throttle but the pedals frequently proved to be
            an issue and no one knew fully the correct procedure for takeoff or landing. This showed the need for a
            structured tutorial</p>
          <p>- The tutorial covers takeoff, flight, and landing. Each section describes what you should be doing in text
            with animated gifs showing the relevant locations on the screen and animations of what you should be doing
          </p>
          <p>- Each tutorial can use proximity to points to decide when they’re done. When you’re high enough in the air
            you’ve taken off, when you’re at cruising altitude you’re flying, and when you’re close to the final airport
            it’ll tell you how to land</p>
          <p>- Unfortunately, a lot of learning a plane can be boiled down to intuition so users may not get this
            correct on their first try but that’s the point of a simulation</p>
        </ol>
      </div>

    <!-- Input Section -->
    <section class="features-workflow">
      <h2 class="header-body">Input</h2>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Physics Forces</h3>
        <img src="Images/PlaneDiagram.png"
          alt="diagram of an airplane with arrows displaying different physics forces such as wind resistance, gravity, lift, and the movement of the plane itself.">
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Basic Input</h3>
        <p>We used the Raw Input plugin for Windows to support multiple custom controllers. Inputs from pedals,
          throttles, and sticks were manually mapped to avoid overlap between devices.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Wind Resistance & Gravity</h3>
        <p>To stabilize aircraft physics, drag and gravity balance input forces. Altitude, plane tilt, and gear
          positioning all affect drag efficiency, encouraging players to fly at optimal cruising altitudes.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Environment Section -->
    <section class="features-workflow">
      <h2 class="header-body">Environment</h2>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Visual Navigation</h3>
        <p>The GPS is integrated into the cockpit screen, showing a dot for the player’s position and another for the
          destination. A connecting line guides flight. Once close enough, both disappear and the player is notified of
          arrival.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Logic Section -->
    <section class="features-workflow">
      <h2 class="header-body">Logic</h2>
      <ul class="logic-list">
        <li>🔥 <strong>Igniting the Scene:</strong> Imported Unity’s Particle Pack and applied a fire effect to a house
          model to simulate a realistic blaze.</li>
        <li>📈 <strong>Growing the Flames:</strong> Wrote a script that increases the fire’s scale over time, creating
          the illusion of a spreading and intensifying fire.</li>
        <li>🧱 <strong>Fire Gets Physical:</strong> Added colliders to the fire so it can interact with other
          objects—especially water.</li>
        <li>💧 <strong>Equipping the Firetruck:</strong> Designed a water spray particle system and attached it to the
          front of the firetruck’s hose.</li>
        <li>🎮 <strong>User Control:</strong> Mapped hose rotation to the Logitech G920’s steering wheel, allowing
          players to aim the water manually.</li>
        <li>🕹️ <strong>Triggering the Response:</strong> Set up a button on the G920 to activate the water spray,
          simulating firefighting on command.</li>
        <li>🔄 <strong>Collision Detection:</strong> Gave the water particles colliders and scripted interactions to
          detect contact with fire particles.</li>
        <li>🌧️ <strong>Fire Meets Water:</strong> When water hits the fire, the fire’s size is reduced
          dynamically—visually representing the extinguishing process.</li>
      </ul>
