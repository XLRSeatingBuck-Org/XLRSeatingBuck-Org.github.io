      <h2 class="header-body">Key Features and Workflow</h2>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Choose your experience</h3>
        <p>As with the rest of the XR seating buck, the jet simulation is meant to be interactive. Use VR or a normal
          screen, fully adjust your physical environment, play with keyboard or mockups of real A-10C warthog hardware
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Realistic Plane Physics</h3>
        <p>The car simulation is powered by realistic car physics in Unreal Engine, enabling dynamic interactions with
          the environment. Using input from hardware like manual transmission, steering wheels, and pedals, the car
          mimics real-world driving behavior, enhancing the immersion of the simulation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Interactive interior</h3>
        <p>The interior of the jet plane features several elements taken from real airplanes to help you more easily
          learn to fly. A working GPS; a HUD telling you your speed, pitch, and yaw with a horizon marker; and cameras
          to help you see the outside of your plane from different angles</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Problem Statement Section -->
    <section class="features-workflow">
      <h2 class="header-body">Problem Statement</h2>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Teaching Flight Basics</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this program is to teach the user the basics of how they could fly an airplane. This needs to
          be accomplished in two parts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Realistic Physics Simulation</li>
          <p>- The airplane must be made to feel as similar to a real plane as possible by gathering as much reference
            material as possible. This was done through a combination of studying airplane cockpit tour videos, airplane
            flight videos, jet plane discussion forums, and a few pages describing airplane physics</p>
          <li>A detailed tutorial</li>
          <p>- While having all of the features is nice, most users won’t be able to intuit how to fly an airplane. When
            testing with my teammates, everyone knew how to operate the throttle but the pedals frequently proved to be
            an issue and no one knew fully the correct procedure for takeoff or landing. This showed the need for a
            structured tutorial</p>
          <p>- The tutorial covers takeoff, flight, and landing. Each section describes what you should be doing in text
            with animated gifs showing the relevant locations on the screen and animations of what you should be doing
          </p>
          <p>- Each tutorial can use proximity to points to decide when they’re done. When you’re high enough in the air
            you’ve taken off, when you’re at cruising altitude you’re flying, and when you’re close to the final airport
            it’ll tell you how to land</p>
          <p>- Unfortunately, a lot of learning a plane can be boiled down to intuition so users may not get this
            correct on their first try but that’s the point of a simulation</p>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </section>


  
  <!-- Input Section -->
  <section class="features-workflow">
    <h2 class="header-body">Input</h2>
  
    <div class="feature-item">
      <img src="Images/InputDiagram.png" style="max-width: 50%;" />
      <p>Input in Unity is abstracted into generic actions that are read out as a data type (bool for button, float for slider, etc). This way, the code doesn't have to worry about specific devices or combinations of devices. Mapping controllers to actions is as simple as pressing a button on the controller and listening for said button.</p>

    <div class="feature-item">
      <h3>Location Building Data</h3>
      <p>We used ArcGIS CityEngine to extract a region of Corvallis. This region includes the location, size, and shape of buildings, trees, and roads. This data was exported as an fbx object and textures, and then imported into Unity. Cesium's Bing map data provides the visuals for the rest of the world, to ground the city model in it's location.</p>

    <!-- Logic Section -->
    <section class="features-workflow">
      <h2 class="header-body">Logic</h2>
      <ul class="logic-list">
        <li>🔥 <strong>Igniting the Scene:</strong> Imported Unity’s Particle Pack and applied a fire effect to a house
          model to simulate a realistic blaze.</li>
        <li>📈 <strong>Growing the Flames:</strong> Wrote a script that increases the fire’s scale over time, creating
          the illusion of a spreading and intensifying fire.</li>
        <li>🧱 <strong>Fire Gets Physical:</strong> Added colliders to the fire so it can interact with other
          objects—especially water.</li>
        <li>💧 <strong>Equipping the Firetruck:</strong> Designed a water spray particle system and attached it to the
          front of the firetruck’s hose.</li>
        <li>🎮 <strong>User Control:</strong> Mapped hose rotation to the Logitech G920’s steering wheel, allowing
          players to aim the water manually.</li>
        <li>🕹️ <strong>Triggering the Response:</strong> Set up a button on the G920 to activate the water spray,
          simulating firefighting on command.</li>
        <li>🔄 <strong>Collision Detection:</strong> Gave the water particles colliders and scripted interactions to
          detect contact with fire particles.</li>
        <li>🌧️ <strong>Fire Meets Water:</strong> When water hits the fire, the fire’s size is reduced
          dynamically—visually representing the extinguishing process.</li>
      </ul>
